Body: 

I recently saw a frequently recurring log message starting to pop up in the logs for my Mac app Notenik. I couldn't find any info on the Web about the message, so I filed a Technical Support Incident with Apple. Their response was to write it off as Log Noise. See the Apple Developer Forums discussion for more info on the topic
