Body: 

A guard statement is used to transfer program control out of a scope if one or more conditions arenâ€™t met.

A guard statement offers a shorthand way of testing for conditions that must be met in order to proceed, and then exiting if the conditions aren't met. 

The condition must be of type `Bool` or something that evaluates to true or false; or the condition can be an [[Optional Binding]] declaration. 

If the test fails, then the statements to be executed must transfer control using one of the following statements:

* return
* break
* continue
* throw

The other possibility for satisfying this requirement is to call a function with the Never return type.
