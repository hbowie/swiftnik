Body: 

Some types in Swift are reference types, while others are [[value type]]s. 

When a reference type is assigned or passed via an argument, it is a reference to the original type that is passed, so that any further changes are reflected in the original. 

The following types in Swift are reference types:

* [[class]]
* [[closure]]
* [[function]]
