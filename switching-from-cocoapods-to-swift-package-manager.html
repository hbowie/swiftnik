			<h3>switching from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager</h3>

<p>My Notenik app makes use of a few third-party libraries. I had originally just downloaded the libraries I needed directly, but then started using CocoaPods. CocoaPods worked great, but then I ran across a library I wanted to try that was not set up for CocoaPods use. After some online checking, it seemed that <a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/">Swift Package Manager</a> was now far enough along that I could use it as a dependency manager for my Mac app. So I decided to rip out CocoaPods and instead try out SPM. </p>
<p>It turned out to be pretty easy. Here's how I did it. </p>
<p>Step 1 was to download and run the <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-deintegrate">cocoapods-deintegrate plugin</a>. I just followed the instructions provided in the README file. </p>
<p>Next thing I did was to go over the instructions for manual removal provided in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16427421/how-to-remove-cocoapods-from-a-project">StackOverflow discussion</a>. There were a few things left by the deintegrate plugin, so I then threw these in the trash: </p>
<ul>
<li>Podfile </li>
<li>Podfile.lock </li>
<li>The generated file with the &#8216;.xcworkspace&#8217; extension. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now I just opened my &#8216;.xcodeproj&#8217; file. </p>
<p>Then, looking under the Xcode File menu, I found an entry towards the bottom for Swift Packages. I picked &#8216;Add Package Dependency&#8230;&#8217; from that submenu, and then repeated that step for each of my primary dependencies, filling in the GitHub address for each. </p>
<p>That was it! Couldn't have been easier! </p>
