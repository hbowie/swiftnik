Body: 

A blue folder within the Xcode project navigator represents a folder reference. This is what results, when copying a folder into a project, when "Copy items if needed" is *not* selected, and when "Create folder references" is selected instead of "Create groups".

The alternative would be a [[yellow folder]].
