Body: 

*Curly braces* are generally used to enclose a block containing one or more statements. 

Note, though, that for an inline [[closure expression]], the parameters and return type are written inside the curly braces, not outside of them, which is why the keyword [[in]] must be used in this context to indicate the beginning of the body.
