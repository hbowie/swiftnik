Title:  yellow folder

Tags:   Xcode

Body: 

A yellow folder in the project navigator within Xcode indicates a folder/group that fully exists within the project folder. When dragging a folder into the Xcode project navigator, this is the result you will see when you have selected "Copy items if needed" and "Create groups". 

A possible alternative would be a [[blue folder]].
