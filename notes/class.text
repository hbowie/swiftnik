Body: 

Structures and classes are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your programâ€™s code. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your structures and classes using the same syntax you use to define constants, variables, and functions.

Note that a class is a [[reference type]], whereas a [[struct]] is a [[value type]].
